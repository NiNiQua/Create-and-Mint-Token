- Open Remix in your web browser: https://remix.ethereum.org/
- Create a new Solidity file by clicking on the "Create" button.
- Copy and paste the contract code into the new file.
-
Instead of copying and pasting the contract code, you can also import it directly.
- Download the file and click "Open a File from your File System" to import the contract code into Remix.

Once you've importeed the contract code, you can proceed with compiling and deploying the contract.

### Executing program
